# Introduction to Machine Learning 

This repo contains materials for the Introduction to Machine Learning Tutorial during the SOAR 9 Meeting at the University of Washington, Seattle, May 2018.

In this tutorial we will introduce both supervised and unsupervised methods for learning from data, explain how to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, and discuss approaches for handling temporal and spatial correlations in the signals. 


We will use Anaconda Python 3.6, so please install it on your laptop in advance:
